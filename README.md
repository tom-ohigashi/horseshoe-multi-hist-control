# Using horseshoe prior for incorporating multiple historical control data in randomized controlled trials

This repository contains the code used to completion the case study in a manuscript (being under peer review) entitled "Using horseshoe prior for incorporating multiple historical control data in randomized controlled trials" by Tomohiro Ohigashi, Kazushi Maruo, Takashi Sozu and Masahiko Gosho.
The following files are included:

- BIN_case_study.R: Code for completing a clinical trial example with binary endpoint reported in manuscript.

- Surv_case_study.R: Code for completing a clinical trial example with time-to-event endpoint reported in manuscript. Note – because the raw data for this example are not publicly available, code is provided that generates a dataset that resembles raw data and analyzes it.

- Surv_cov_case_study.R: Code for completing a clinical trial example with time-to-event endpoint and covariate adjustment reported in manuscript. Note – because the raw data for this example are not publicly available, code is provided that generates a dataset that resembles raw data and analyzes it.

- Stan_bin, Stan_surv, Stan_surv_cov: Directory containing stan codes called in each sample code.

## Software Dependencies
All code and analyses generated in R version 4.1.1 and used Stan via *cmdstnr* 0.4.0 package.
