# Using horseshoe prior for incorporating multiple historical control data in randomized controlled trials

This repository contains the code used to completion the case study in a manuscript entitled ["Using horseshoe prior for incorporating multiple historical control data in randomized controlled trials"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09622802221090752) by Tomohiro Ohigashi, Kazushi Maruo, Takashi Sozu and Masahiko Gosho.
The following files are included:

- `BIN_case_study.R`: Code for completing a clinical trial example with binary endpoint reported in manuscript.

- `Surv_case_study.R`: Code for completing a clinical trial example with time-to-event endpoint. Note – since the raw data for the example reported in manuscript is not publicly available, this code generates a simulated dataset and analyzes it.

- `Surv_cov_case_study.R`: Code for completing a clinical trial example with time-to-event endpoint with or without cthe ovariate adjustment. Note – since the raw data for the example reported in manuscript is not publicly available, this code generates a simulated dataset and analyzes it.

- `Stan_BIN`, `Stan_Surv`, `Stan_Surv_Cov`: Directory containing stan codes called in each sample code.

## Software Dependencies
All code and analyses generated in R version 4.1.1 and used Stan via `cmdstnr` package (version 0.4.0).
